In newer versions though, lazy loading should work for any plugin. If you have a problem related to this please try disabling lazy loading and see if that fixes it. Feel free to open an issue on this repo too.\n\n## Credit\n\nCredit largely goes to @sindresorhus for his [load-grunt-plugins](https://github.com/sindresorhus/load-grunt-tasks) plugin. This plugin is almost identical, just tweaked slightly to work with Gulp and to expose the required plugins.\n\n## Changelog\n\n#####0.5.1\n- Updated some internal dependencies which should see some small improvements - thanks @shinnn for this contribution.\n\n#####0.5.0\n- improved lazy loading so it should work with plugins that don't just return a function. Thanks to @nfroidure for help with this.\n\n#####0.4.0\n- plugins are lazy loaded for performance benefit. Thanks @julien-f for this.\n\n#####0.3.0\n- turn the `camelize` option on by default\n\n#####0.2.0\n- added `camelize` option, thanks @kombucha.\n- renamed to `gulp-load-plugins`.\n\n#####0.1.1\n- add link to this repository into `package.json` (thanks @ben-eb).\n\n#####0.1.0\n- move to `gulpLoadplugins` returning an object with the tasks define.\n\n#####0.0.5\n- added `replaceString` option to configure exactly what gets replace when the plugin adds the module to the context\n\n#####0.0.4\n- fixed keyword typo so plugin appears in search for gulp plugins\n\n#####0.0.3\n- removed accidental console.log I'd left in\n\n#####0.0.2\n- fixed accidentally missing a dependency out of package.json\n\n#####0.0.1\n- initial release\n\n\n\n",
