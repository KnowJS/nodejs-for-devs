  "readme": "# method-override [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/expressjs/method-override.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/expressjs/method-override) [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/method-override.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/method-override)\n\nLets you use HTTP verbs such as PUT or DELETE in places you normally can't.\n\nPreviously `connect.methodOverride()`.\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\n$ npm install method-override\n```\n\n## API\n\n**NOTE** It is very important that this module is used **before** any module that\nneeds to know the method of the request (for example, it _must_ be used prior to\nthe `csurf` module).\n\n### methodOverride(key)\n\nCreate a new middleware function to override the `req.method` property with a new\nvalue. This value will be pulled from the `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header of the\nrequest. If this header is not present, then this module will look in the `req.body`\nobject for a property name given by the `key` argument (and if found, will delete\nthe property from `req.body`).\n\nIf the found method is supported by node.js core, then `req.method` will be set to\nthis value, as if it has originally been that value. The previous `req.method`\nvalue will be stored in `req.originalMethod`.\n\n#### key\n\nThis is the property to look for the overwritten method in the `req.body` object.\nThis defaults to `\"_method\"`.\n\n## Examples\n\n```js\nvar bodyParser = require('body-parser')\nvar connect = require('connect')\nvar methodOverride = require('method-override')\n\napp.use(bodyParser())\napp.use(methodOverride())\n```\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Jonathan Ong me@jongleberry.com\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
